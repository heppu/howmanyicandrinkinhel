#How many can I drink in HEL

Terrible application for most useless app in hackjunction 2015 by team corbaKotka.
This application tries to calculate time in Helsinki Vantaa airport during two flights and estimate how many beers you can drink in Oak Barrel durin that time.

Backend takes to flight ids as argument, makes google search for those flights and tries to parse time information.
